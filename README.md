# Landing-Page

Creation of test landing page template.

Added significant CSS. Page functions fine, but is more of a testing ground for various CSS principals such as grouping/chaining selectors, Descendant combinators as well as primarily Flexbox.

To do: Add sticky header, mobile responsiveness (currently has very little) and some JavaScript.
